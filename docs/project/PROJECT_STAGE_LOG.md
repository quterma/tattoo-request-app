## Current Stage

Stage: Stage 4A — Admin Authentication
Status: In progress

Current focus:

- Stage 4A.1 complete — Stage 4A.2 complete — Stage 4A.3 complete — Stage 4A.4 complete — Stage 4A.5 complete — Stage 4A.6 complete — Stage 4A.7.1 (documentation) complete — Stage 4A.7.2 (implementation) complete — Stage 4A.8 audit complete — Stage 4A.8 fix pass complete — Stage 4A closed — proceeding to Stage 4B

Completed stages:

- Stage 3 — Request Flow ✓
- Stage 3D — Request Identity & Idempotency ✓
- Stage 3D.5.1 — Architecture & Documentation Audit ✓
- Stage 3D.5.2 — Audit Fix Pass ✓
- Stage 3D.5.3 — Supabase CLI Migration Workflow ✓
- Stage 3D.6 — Domain Foundation ✓

Note: Stage 3E (Telegram Notifications + Stabilization) was superseded by the roadmap
restructure on 2026-06-28. Telegram moved to Stage 2 (Post-Launch). Stabilization
responsibilities absorbed into Stage 5 (Production Hardening).

Architecture decisions confirmed for Stage 3C.2:

- Private Supabase Storage bucket: `request-images`
- Folder structure: `request-images/{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/`
- Storage filenames: deterministic (`reference-01.jpg`, `placement-01.jpg`, ...) — not original filenames
- Image access: signed URLs generated server-side; Image Proxy rejected
- Images: originals stored without compression or resizing
- `clientSubmissionId` introduced in 3C.2.1 for storage use; full idempotency remains Stage 3D
- Upload reliability: per-file retry, 2–3 attempts, backoff, transient failures only
- Failure handling: all-or-nothing; cleanup + logging on upload failure and DB failure

Completed in Stage 3:

- form config (SIZE_OPTIONS, COLOR_OPTIONS, PLACEMENT_OPTIONS, MAX_FILES_PER_FIELD)
- zod validation schema with all fields and cross-field contact rule (migrated to zod/v3 for @hookform/resolvers compat)
- RequestFormData and RequestFormInput types inferred from schema
- i18n namespace `request` added to en.json (labels, placeholders, hints, errors, options)
- request page route wired (`app/[locale]/(public)/request/page.tsx`)
- local form primitives: TextInput, TextareaInput, SelectInput, CheckboxInput, Button, FileUploadInput
- RequestForm fully implemented with RHF + zodResolver, all fields, mock submit
- error handling redesigned: schema uses stable custom message keys; lib/errors.ts has flat MESSAGE_TO_I18N_KEY map + getFieldError/getContactGroupError helpers; RequestForm uses local err() shorthand — no type aliases or nested maps in form file
- final cleanup: lib/ layer added to feature, all component ids explicit, buttonText i18n-controlled, eslint allow-list updated for features/*/lib/**
- select UX fixed: defaultValues for placement/size/color set to "" + z.preprocess in schema so placeholder is shown initially and "" is treated as missing value
- upload trigger text updated to i18n key with maxFiles interpolation ("Choose up to {maxFiles} images.")
- deferred file-upload UX documented in PROJECT_BACKLOG.md
- server validation: validateRequestPayload() in BFF reuses requestFormSchema; POST /api/request returns 400 + structured errors or 500 on exception; consent "true" → boolean true conversion in parseRequestFormData
- server validation UX: VALIDATION_ERROR fieldErrors mapped to RHF setError(); status reset to "idle" after field errors; empty fieldErrors falls back to generic error; 3 new tests added
- file transport validation: validateFiles() in BFF checks MIME type (jpeg/png/webp/heic/heif) and size (≤10 MB per file); integrated into route after validateRequestPayload; errors flow through existing fieldErrors contract; upload format hints added to FileUploadInput fields; 9 new tests
- pre-3C fixes: consent type made honest (true | undefined), success response gated on response.ok === true, contact field labels cleaned up
- Supabase foundation: @supabase/supabase-js installed; config layer (src/config/index.ts) reads SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY with fail-fast validation; server-side Supabase client in src/services/supabase.ts exported through src/services/index.ts; .env.example created
- clientName field: required `clientName` added to form, schema (trim, min 2, max 30), BFF parsing, route handler, db.ts; wired to existing `client_name` DB column via RPC; 8 new tests (schema validation, BFF parsing, form FormData, db persistence mapping)

## Log Entries (reverse chronological)

### 2026-07-01 — Stage 4A.8 — Audit fix pass; Stage 4A closed

Status: Completed

Non-blocking findings from the Stage 4A.8 audit addressed:

- **Origin construction:** `getRequestOrigin(headers)` added to `src/services/supabaseAuth.ts`; derives `protocol://host` preferring `x-forwarded-host`/`x-forwarded-proto` (reverse-proxy-set, not client-controlled in production) over the raw `Host` header. Replaces duplicated inline origin logic previously in `googleLoginAction` and `forgotPasswordAction`. No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env var introduced; local dev and production both continue to resolve correctly (Vercel sets these headers; local dev falls through to `host`).
- **Callback duplication:** documented as an accepted, intentional tradeoff in `PROJECT_DECISIONS.md` (Password Reset section) — `/auth/callback` and `/auth/reset-callback` remain separate, not merged.
- **`getUser()` consistency:** `getOptionalUser(cookies)` extracted in `src/services/auth.ts` — returns the user or `null`, treating `AuthSessionMissingError` as "no user" and rethrowing any other error. `getAuthenticatedStudioMember()` now calls it internally (no behavior change — pure extraction). `login/page.tsx` and `reset-password/page.tsx` now call `getOptionalUser()` instead of the SSR client's `getUser()` directly, so unexpected auth errors are no longer silently discarded. 4 new tests added for `getOptionalUser` in `src/services/__tests__/auth.test.ts` (total 10 tests in file).
- **Admin i18n:** all Stage 4A auth UI strings (login, forgot-password, reset-password, protected-layout header/unauthorized/sign-out) moved from hardcoded English literals to a new `admin` namespace in `src/shared/i18n/messages/en.json`. Server Components and Server Actions use `getTranslations({ locale, namespace: "admin" })` from `next-intl/server` (first use of the server-side next-intl API in this codebase — Client Components previously only used `useTranslations`). Client Components (`LoginForm`, `ForgotPasswordForm`, `ResetPasswordForm`, `SignOutButton`) receive translated strings as props from their Server Component parent rather than calling `next-intl` themselves. No ru/he translations added; no visual or behavioral change — this is a like-for-like string relocation. `(protected)/page.tsx` (Stage 4B admin dashboard placeholder) intentionally left untouched — out of Stage 4A scope.
- Manual end-to-end password-reset verification (flagged as outstanding in the Stage 4A.7.2 log entry) completed successfully.
- No Stage 4B work performed; no password policy or show/hide-password toggle added (both remain in `PROJECT_BACKLOG.md`); no callback merge.
- Total tests: 117 (was 113) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS
- `PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`, `docs/files-structure.md`: updated

**Stage 4A — Admin Authentication is now CLOSED.** All sub-stages (4A.1–4A.8) complete; audit findings resolved; manual verification complete. Proceeding to Stage 4B.

### 2026-07-01 — Stage 4A.8 — Final Architecture & Production Readiness Audit

Status: Completed (audit only, no code changes)

Full audit conducted per PROJECT_PRODUCTION_READINESS.md — Architecture & Documentation Audit Checkpoints protocol. Verdict: READY AFTER MINOR FIXES. No Critical or High findings. Medium/Low findings (origin construction duplication, callback route duplication, admin i18n gap, `getUser()` error-handling inconsistency) addressed in the fix pass above.

---

### 2026-07-01 — Stage 4A.7.2 — Password Reset implementation

Status: Completed

Completed, exactly per the Stage 4A.7.1 documented architecture:

- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/forgot-password/page.tsx` + `ForgotPasswordForm.tsx` + `actions.ts`: `forgotPasswordAction(locale, prev, formData)` calls `resetPasswordForEmail(email, { redirectTo })` via SSR auth client (writable cookies); `redirectTo` points at `/auth/reset-callback?locale=<locale>`; always returns `{ sent: true }` regardless of the Supabase result — no user enumeration; `?error=reset` renders an inline expired/invalid-link message; link back to login
- `app/auth/reset-callback/route.ts`: fixed non-locale route, separate from `app/auth/callback/route.ts`; reads `code`/`locale`, validates locale with the same `isSupportedLocale` pattern as the OAuth callback; missing code or `exchangeCodeForSession` error → redirect to `forgot-password?error=reset`; success → redirect to `reset-password`; no authorization or business logic
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/reset-password/page.tsx` + `ResetPasswordForm.tsx` + `actions.ts`: page checks for an active session with a read-only cookie handler; no session → "Reset link has expired or is no longer valid." with a link to `forgot-password`; session present → password + confirm-password form; `resetPasswordAction` validates both fields present and matching, calls `updateUser({ password })`, immediately calls `signOut()` on success, then redirects to `login?reset=success`; generic error message on failure (no technical details)
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/page.tsx`: renders inline "Password updated. Please sign in with your new password." on `?reset=success`; added "Forgot password?" link to `forgot-password`; existing email/password and Google OAuth behavior unchanged
- Password minimum length: `minLength={6}` HTML attribute only (matches Supabase's default server-side minimum) — no new validation library, no extracted schema, per the "keep Supabase-level validation only" option
- `proxy.ts`: no change needed — matcher already excludes `/auth` broadly, confirmed before implementation
- No `studio_members` changes; no RBAC; no invite flow; Google OAuth untouched
- No new tests — all three actions and the callback route are Supabase SDK orchestration + Next.js redirects, same category as `loginAction`/`logoutAction`/`app/auth/callback/route.ts` (not tested per strategy); no isolated project-owned logic (e.g. extracted schema or locale-fallback helper) existed to unit-test separately
- Total tests: 113 — all pass (unchanged)
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `docs/files-structure.md`, `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`: updated
- No deviation from the Stage 4A.7.1 documented architecture — `PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`, `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` unchanged

Manual verification still required (not yet performed in this session): forgot-password with existing/non-existing email → same generic message; real email link → `reset-password`; expired/reused/bad code → `forgot-password?error=reset`; password mismatch → inline error; successful reset → forced sign-out → login with new password; `/admin` still requires auth + `studio_members` (unchanged, not touched this stage).

Manual Supabase dashboard setup still required (not code, not committed): add `http://localhost:3000/auth/reset-callback` (and later the production origin) to Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs; verify the default "Reset Password" email template / `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`. No new secrets, no Google Cloud changes, no env changes.

---

### 2026-07-01 — Stage 4A.7.1 — Password Reset documentation-first update

Status: Documentation only — implementation not started

Documented (agreed architecture, prior to implementation):

- Routes: `admin/forgot-password/{page,actions}.ts`, `auth/reset-callback/route.ts`, `admin/reset-password/{page,actions}.ts` — both admin pages outside `(protected)`
- Dedicated `/auth/reset-callback`, separate from `/auth/callback` (OAuth-only) — different destination, different risk profile, avoids hidden branching in a route documented elsewhere as "no business logic"
- Full flow recorded: `resetPasswordForEmail` → email → `exchangeCodeForSession` → `reset-password` page → `updateUser({ password })` → forced `signOut()` → redirect to `login?reset=success`
- Recovery session caveat: Supabase does not issue a distinct "recovery-only" session type; the session from `exchangeCodeForSession` is a normal session indistinguishable at the cookie level from a regular login. Accepted MVP mitigation is routing discipline (reset-password outside `(protected)`) + forced sign-out after password update — not a hard session-type barrier. A real barrier would require a client-side Supabase auth client listening for `PASSWORD_RECOVERY`, which does not exist in this codebase (SSR/server-actions only) — rejected as over-engineering for a single low-volume admin
- Expired/invalid link UX: callback failure → `forgot-password?error=reset`; `reset-password` page with no session → "Reset link has expired or is no longer valid." state, not a silent login redirect
- User enumeration: `forgot-password` always returns the same generic message regardless of whether the email exists
- Locale preserved via `?locale=` on `redirectTo`, same mechanism as Google OAuth (4A.6)
- Link scanners/prefetching documented as a known limitation (pre-opened links can consume single-use codes) — no mitigation planned for MVP
- Manual Supabase setup documented: add `/auth/reset-callback` to the Redirect URLs allow-list (dev now, prod later); verify default Reset Password email template; no new secrets, no Google Cloud changes, no env changes
- Test approach documented: no unit tests expected by default (same category as `loginAction`/`logoutAction`/OAuth callback); manual end-to-end verification required
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` intentionally not updated — documents only files that exist; will be updated during implementation like every prior stage
- No code changes; no package changes
- lint / typecheck / test / build — all PASS (no source changed)

Files updated: `PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`, `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`

### 2026-07-01 — Stage 4A.6 fix — OAuth callback error handling

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `app/auth/callback/route.ts`: missing `code` now redirects to `/${locale}/admin/login?error=oauth` instead of proceeding to `/${locale}/admin`
- `exchangeCodeForSession(code)` result is now checked; on `error`, redirects to `/${locale}/admin/login?error=oauth` instead of unconditionally redirecting to admin
- Previously, a failed or missing code exchange still redirected to `/${locale}/admin`, relying on the protected layout's `unauthenticated` branch to redirect back to login — functionally recoverable but silent (no error surfaced) and slower (extra redirect hop)
- No authorization or business logic added; locale fallback unchanged; admin redirect only reached on confirmed session exchange
- No new tests — same category as the rest of the callback route (Supabase SDK result branching + Next.js redirect, not tested per strategy)
- Total tests: 113 — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-07-01 — Stage 4A.6 — Google OAuth

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/actions.ts` — `googleLoginAction(locale)` server action added: calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: "google", options: { redirectTo, skipBrowserRedirect: true } })` via SSR auth client with writable cookies; redirects the browser to the returned Google consent URL; redirects to `/${locale}/admin/login?error=oauth` on failure
- Chose server-action + `skipBrowserRedirect: true` over a browser Supabase client after explicit evaluation: fully PKCE-correct (code verifier persisted via the same writable `CookieHandler` already used by `loginAction`/`logoutAction`), requires no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env vars, and introduces no new client-side Supabase client module
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/LoginForm.tsx` — added a second, separate `<form>` with a `Google` button wired to `googleAction` (server action passed as prop); no styling beyond existing primitives; kept as a sibling form, not nested, to stay valid HTML
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/page.tsx` — binds `googleLoginAction` to locale; reads `?error=oauth` search param and renders an inline error message when present
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` created: fixed non-locale Route Handler; reads `code` + `locale` query params; exchanges code for session via `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession()` (SSR auth client, writable cookies); redirects to `/${locale}/admin` (`defaultLocale` fallback if `locale` missing/unsupported); no authorization or business logic — admin `(protected)` layout performs the authorization check after redirect, unchanged
- Locale preservation: `redirectTo` passed to `signInWithOAuth` includes `?locale=<locale>`; Google and Supabase preserve this query param through the redirect chain back to `/auth/callback`
- `proxy.ts`: matcher updated to exclude `/auth` (alongside existing `/api`, `/_next`, `/_vercel` exclusions) — without this, the fixed non-locale `/auth/callback` route would have been redirected to `/${defaultLocale}/auth/callback` by the locale-redirect logic, breaking the OAuth round trip. Found and fixed before implementation, per user confirmation.
- No `studio_members` changes; no invite flow; no RBAC; no password reset — out of scope per stage definition. A Google-authenticated user with no `studio_members` row still hits the existing `unauthorized` branch in the protected admin layout (unchanged from Stage 4A.3–4A.5)
- No new tests — both new code paths orchestrate Supabase SDK calls + Next.js redirects, same category as `loginAction`/`logoutAction` (not tested per strategy)
- Total tests: 113 — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `docs/files-structure.md`, `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`: updated

Required manual Supabase/Google dashboard setup (not code, not committed):

1. Google Cloud Console: create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application). Authorized redirect URI: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
2. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google: enable, paste the Google Client ID and Client Secret.
3. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration: add the app's `/auth/callback` URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` for local dev, plus the production origin) to the Redirect URLs allow-list — `signInWithOAuth`'s `redirectTo` must match an allowed URL or Supabase rejects it.
4. No secrets stored in this repo; Google Client ID/Secret live only in the Supabase dashboard.

Manual verification still required (not yet performed in this session): click Google → complete Google login → return to app → confirm authenticated-but-not-a-`studio_members`-member sees "This account is not authorized." → confirm a `studio_members` member reaches `/admin`.

Concern flagged before Stage 4A.7 (password reset): none blocking. Note that the `?error=oauth` query param on the login page is a plain URL param, not itself a security-sensitive value — no action needed, but worth being aware of when adding the password-reset request/confirm flow, which will introduce its own query-param-carried state (reset token) requiring more care.

### 2026-07-01 — Stage 4A.5 fix — Sign out from unauthorized state

Status: Completed

Completed:

- Manual testing found authenticated-but-unauthorized users (no `studio_members` row) had no way to sign out — stuck on "This account is not authorized." with an active session
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/(protected)/layout.tsx`: unauthorized branch now also renders `SignOutButton` (reused as-is) above the message; `boundLogoutAction` moved above both branches so it's available to both
- No changes to `actions.ts` or `SignOutButton.tsx` — fully reused
- No changes to authorization logic or `studio_members`
- No new tests — same rationale as Stage 4A.5 (orchestration only)
- Total tests: 113 — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS
- `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`: updated; `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` unchanged (no new files, no responsibility changes)

---

### 2026-07-01 — Stage 4A.5 — Logout

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/(protected)/actions.ts` — `logoutAction(locale)` server action: calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` via SSR auth client with writable cookies, then redirects to `/${locale}/admin/login`
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/(protected)/SignOutButton.tsx` — Client Component; form wired to the locale-bound `logoutAction`
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/(protected)/layout.tsx` — minimal header added (renders only once auth + authorization checks pass): "Admin" label + `SignOutButton`; unauthenticated/unauthorized branches unchanged
- Logout terminates authentication only — no `studio_members` writes, no authorization logic; `getAuthenticatedStudioMember()` remains the sole authorization gate
- No new tests — `logoutAction` orchestrates Supabase SDK + Next.js redirect, same category as `loginAction` (not tested per strategy)
- Total tests: 113 — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`, `docs/files-structure.md`: updated

---

### 2026-06-30 — Stage 4A.4 — Email/Password Login Page

Status: Completed

Completed:

- Route group restructured: `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/layout.tsx` moved to `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/(protected)/layout.tsx` and `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/page.tsx` moved to `(protected)/page.tsx`. This is required: the old layout wrapped the login page, causing an infinite redirect loop for unauthenticated users. The `(protected)` route group excludes the login route. URLs are unchanged.
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/actions.ts` — `loginAction(locale, prev, formData)` server action: calls `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` via SSR auth client with writable cookies; on success redirects to `/${locale}/admin`; on failure returns `{ error: "Invalid email or password." }` (no technical details exposed)
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/LoginForm.tsx` — Client Component; uses `useActionState` for server action integration; inline error display; loading state ("Signing in…") while pending
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/page.tsx` — Server Component; reads Supabase session on render; authenticated user → redirect to `/${locale}/admin`; unauthenticated → renders LoginForm with locale-bound action
- Authenticated users visiting `/[locale]/admin/login` are redirected to `/[locale]/admin` (server-side, before page renders)
- Logout remains Stage 4A.5; Google OAuth remains Stage 4A.6
- No new tests for login page — orchestrates Supabase SDK + Next.js redirect (not tested per strategy); `loginAction` error branch is a pass-through of an external SDK result
- Bugfix (pre-commit): `getAuthenticatedStudioMember()` now treats `AuthSessionMissingError` from `getUser()` as `unauthenticated` instead of throwing — unauthenticated access to `/[locale]/admin` now correctly redirects to login instead of crashing. New test added for this case. See `src/services/auth.ts`.
- Total tests: 113 — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`: updated

---

### 2026-06-30 — Stage 4A.3 — Admin Route Protection

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/layout.tsx` created: server component auth gate
- Calls `getAuthenticatedStudioMember()` with read-only cookie handler (setAll no-op — server component cannot write cookies; middleware handles refresh)
- No session (`unauthenticated`) → `redirect(`/${locale}/admin/login`)`
- Session but no `studio_members` row (`unauthorized`) → renders `<p>This account is not authorized.</p>`
- Session + membership → renders `{children}`
- `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/page.tsx` created: minimal placeholder so redirect target resolves; no form, no auth logic
- `eslint.config.mjs`: `**/services/auth` added to `import/no-internal-modules` allow-list (same pattern as `supabaseAuth`)
- No new tests — layout orchestrates `getAuthenticatedStudioMember` (already tested 6/6) and Next.js framework behavior (not tested per strategy)
- Total tests: 112 — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`: updated

---

### 2026-06-30 — Stage 4A.2 — Shared Authorization Function

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `src/services/auth.ts` created: `getAuthenticatedStudioMember(cookies: CookieHandler)` shared authorization gate
- Returns `AuthResult` discriminated union: `{ ok: true, userId, studioId }` | `{ ok: false, reason: "unauthenticated" | "unauthorized" }`
- Expected auth failures are business outcomes (ok: false); infrastructure errors (Supabase auth error, DB error) throw
- Session identity via SSR auth client (`createSupabaseAuthClient`); membership via service-role client (`supabase`) querying `studio_members`
- Not exported through `services/index.ts` barrel — intentionally imported directly by callers (same pattern as `supabaseAuth.ts`)
- `src/services/__tests__/auth.test.ts` created: 6 tests — authenticated + member, authenticated + no member, unauthenticated, auth error throws, DB error throws, error message propagated
- Total tests: 112 (was 106) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`, `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`: updated to reflect `AuthResult` discriminated union (was described as `null`-returning in architecture docs)
- Deferred: Supabase generated Database types — `membership.studio_id as string` cast noted; tracked in PROJECT_BACKLOG.md for Stage 5 or earlier

---

### 2026-06-30 — Stage 4A.1 — Supabase SSR Auth Foundation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `@supabase/ssr 0.12.0` installed as dependency
- `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` added to `src/config/index.ts` (`config.supabase.publishableKey`) and `.env.example`
- `src/services/supabaseAuth.ts` created: `createSupabaseAuthClient(cookies)` factory using `@supabase/ssr`; reads `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` directly from `process.env` (does not import `@/config`) to keep service_role config out of the middleware bundle; accepts `CookieHandler` (getAll/setAll) for use in both middleware and server components; scoped to session identity only
- `proxy.ts` extended: session refresh via `supabase.auth.getUser()` after intl middleware runs; cookie read/write wired to request/response; no auth logic, no redirects; i18n behavior unchanged
- `eslint.config.mjs`: `**/services/supabaseAuth` added to `import/no-internal-modules` allow list (intentionally not exported through barrel)
- `docs/project/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: `supabaseAuth.ts` entry updated from planned to implemented
- Quality gates: lint ✓, typecheck ✓, 106/106 tests ✓, build ✓

Note: `.env.local` requires `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` set to the publishable key from the Supabase dashboard (Settings → API Keys → Publishable key). A placeholder is present; replace before running any auth flow.

---

### 2026-06-30 — Stage 4A — Admin Authentication (architecture documentation)

Status: Documentation only — implementation not started

Documented:

- Authentication vs Authorization distinction: Supabase session proves identity; `studio_members` row proves access; both required
- Two Supabase clients: service_role client (existing, DB/Storage) + SSR auth client (new in 4A, session identity only)
- `proxy.ts` role clarified: sole Next.js middleware entry point; will be extended with SSR session refresh; must not create parallel `middleware.ts`
- Admin route protection: no session → redirect to login; session without `studio_members` row → unauthorized page; session + row → admin content
- `getAuthenticatedStudioMember()` planned in `src/services/auth.ts`: returns `AuthResult` discriminated union (`{ ok: true, userId, studioId }` | `{ ok: false, reason }`); Stage 4B handlers must call this and scope data by `studioId`
- Login: `app/[locale]/(admin)/admin/login/page.tsx`; email/password; Google OAuth if feasible
- OAuth callback: `app/auth/callback/route.ts` — code exchange and redirect only; no business logic
- Logout: clears session, locale-aware redirect to login
- Password reset: request-link flow + reset page; recovery session must not grant admin access prematurely
- Manual admin activation: developer inserts `studio_members` row; no invite flow, no RBAC
- Stage 5 boundary: application-layer auth enforcement in Stage 4 is an accepted temporary risk; RLS deferred to Stage 5
- Stage 4A implementation sequence (4A.1 → 4A.8) documented in PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

Files updated: PROJECT_DECISIONS.md, PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md

No code changes.

### 2026-06-30 — Stage 3D.6 — Domain Foundation

Status: Completed

Completed (3D.6.2 — Application Wiring):

- `DEPLOYMENT_STUDIO_ID` added to `.env.example` and `src/config/index.ts` (`config.app.deploymentStudioId`)
- `uploadRequestFiles()` in `src/services/storage.ts`: accepts `studioId` as new second parameter; storage path changed from `{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/{file}` to `{studioId}/{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/{file}`; all existing cleanup/retry behavior unchanged
- `CreateRequestParams` in `src/services/db.ts`: `studioId` field added; `p_studio_id` passed as first argument to `create_request` RPC
- Route handler (`app/api/request/route.ts`): `resolveStudioId()` helper reads `config.app.deploymentStudioId`; `studioId` resolved once and passed to both `uploadRequestFiles` and `createRequest`; resolver is isolated so it can be replaced by slug/domain resolution in Stage 4 without touching the rest of the handler
- Tests updated: `STUDIO_ID` constant added to storage and route fixtures; storage path expectations updated throughout; `p_studio_id` added to db RPC assertion; `@/config` mocked in route.test.ts; two new route assertions added (passes studioId to upload, passes studioId to createRequest)
- Total tests: 106 (was 104) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

Completed (3D.6.1 — DB Migration):

- `supabase/migrations/20260629154719_domain_foundation.sql` applied to remote
- `studios` table: id (UUID PK, fixed seed `2617c7d8-23bb-4269-ab2e-fd104c3d12b8`), name, created_at; GRANT INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE to service_role
- `studio_id` UUID column added to `requests`; all existing rows backfilled to Masha's studio UUID; NOT NULL enforced; FK constraint added
- `studio_members` table: composite PK (user_id, studio_id), references auth.users + studios; GRANT INSERT/SELECT/DELETE to service_role; starts empty (populated in Stage 4A)
- Old `create_request` RPC (12 params) dropped; new `create_request` (13 params, adds p_studio_id) created; REVOKE from PUBLIC / GRANT EXECUTE to service_role
- Migration list confirmed: all 4 migrations Local = Remote
- Quality gates at audit time: 106 tests PASS, lint PASS, typecheck PASS, build PASS

### 2026-06-29 — Stage 3D.6 — Domain Foundation (planning update after architecture review)

Status: Planning updated — implementation pending

Additional decisions recorded:

- Storage path structure changed: `{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/{file}` → `{studioId}/{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/{file}`
  Reason: aligns storage ownership with studio model; makes future Storage RLS policies straightforward.
  Existing stored paths remain valid (DB stores full path); only new uploads use the new structure.
- RLS confirmed NOT included in Stage 3D.6. All three new/updated tables (`studios`, `studio_members`, `requests`) remain without RLS policies until Stage 5. Access goes through service_role only.
- Authentication and authorization model documented: Auth session proves identity; `studio_members` row proves access. Stage 4A must enforce both.
- Staging environment (Supabase + Vercel preview) deferred to Stage 5 as an explicit decision point — not required before 3D.6 or 4A.
- Deferred items confirmed: role column, is_active/soft-delete, invite flow, billing, multi-studio routing.

### 2026-06-28 — Stage 3D.6 — Domain Foundation (initial planning)

Status: Superseded by 2026-06-29 update above

Decisions recorded:

- `studios` and `studio_members` tables defined; schema documented in PROJECT_DECISIONS.md
- `studio_id` FK column will be added to `requests`; backfill strategy for existing rows documented
- `create_request` RPC will be updated to accept `p_studio_id`
- `DEPLOYMENT_STUDIO_ID` env var chosen for single-studio route resolution
- `studio_members` supersedes the earlier `admin_profiles` direction; 4A will use `studio_members` as the access gate
- `getRequestByClientSubmissionId()` confirmed to remain global (no studio filter)
- Stage placed before 4A due to zero-data migration cost
- Stage 3D.6 added to PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with full scope, exit criteria, and deferred items

No code changes.

### 2026-06-24 — Stage 3D.5.3 — Supabase CLI Migration Workflow

Status: Completed

Completed:

- Supabase CLI v2.107.0 installed as project devDependency (`pnpm add -D supabase`)
- `pnpm exec supabase` confirmed as the canonical invocation going forward
- `supabase init` run: `supabase/config.toml` and `supabase/.gitignore` created
- Project linked to remote: `supabase link --project-ref vjjvouihcvqmupjojgrs`
- Pre-repair audit: `migration list` confirmed all three migrations had empty Remote column (expected — all were applied manually via SQL Editor; `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` was empty)
- Migration history repaired (metadata only, no schema changes):
  - `20260622000000` → applied
  - `20260622000001` → applied
  - `20260623000000` → applied
- Post-repair `migration list` confirmed Local = Remote for all three migrations
- Global binary (`C:\Users\danik\AppData\Local\supabase\`) removed; project-local CLI verified working independently
- lint / typecheck / tests (104/104) / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-06-23 — Stage 3D.5 — Architecture & Documentation Audit / Fix Pass

Status: Completed

Audit (3D.5.1):

- Full audit of all PROJECT_* docs, code, migrations, and tests after Stage 3D completion
- Findings: 2 Critical (stale stage log, missing 3D.5 in plan), 3 High (client_name nullable, BUCKET duplicate, stale current focus), several Medium/Low doc gaps
- No code correctness issues found; all quality gates passed; idempotency flow confirmed correct

Fix pass (3D.5.2):

- `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`: removed stale "Next expected step: Stage 3D" block; updated current focus; added completed stages list
- `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: added Stage 3D.5 sub-stage under Stage 3D; added Stage 3D.5.3 planned sub-stage
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: added `clientName` to Request Form scope; corrected status values to match DB CHECK constraint (`new / contacted / booked / completed / rejected`)
- `PROJECT_BACKLOG.md`: removed stale Route-Level Tests backlog item (tests added in Stage 3D.0)
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: added `getRequestByClientSubmissionId()` to services/db.ts section
- `src/services/storage.ts`: exported `BUCKET` constant
- `app/api/request/route.ts`: removed local `BUCKET` definition; imports from `@/services`
- `app/api/request/__tests__/route.test.ts`: added `BUCKET` to `@/services` mock
- `supabase/migrations/20260623000000_make_client_name_not_null.sql`: backfills null `client_name` rows with `[unknown]`, then enforces `NOT NULL` constraint; patch SQL applied manually to live Supabase project
- `PROJECT_PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`: added Architecture Audit Checkpoints section; added E2E integration testing section reference; updated migration workflow note
- `PROJECT_BACKLOG.md`: added Migration Workflow and Automated E2E Tests sections

Documentation sync (3D.5.3 prep):

- `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: added Stage 3D.5.3 — Supabase CLI Migration Workflow
- `PROJECT_PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`: added Architecture Audit Checkpoints section
- Confirmed all planned future items already documented: Repeat Client Indicator ✓, AI Tattoo Title ✓, performance validation ✓, E2E test coverage ✓, dependency/security review ✓

### 2026-06-22 — Stage 3D.0 — Request Identity & Idempotency

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `supabase/migrations/20260622000001_add_client_submission_id_unique.sql` created:
  - `ALTER TABLE requests ADD CONSTRAINT requests_client_submission_id_key UNIQUE (client_submission_id)`
  - Separate migration from Stage 3C.3 — applies cleanly on top of the already-deployed schema
- `getRequestByClientSubmissionId(clientSubmissionId)` added to `src/services/db.ts`:
  - queries `requests` table by `client_submission_id` using `.maybeSingle()`
  - returns existing `reference_code` as string, or `null` if not found
  - throws on Supabase error
  - exported through `src/services/index.ts`
- Route handler (`app/api/request/route.ts`) updated with three-path idempotency flow:
  1. Pre-upload lookup: if `clientSubmissionId` already exists → log `[route] idempotent replay: REQ-XXXX` → return `{ ok: true, referenceCode }` immediately (no upload, no DB insert)
  2. Normal path: lookup returns null → upload files → create request → return `{ ok: true, referenceCode }`
  3. Race-condition fallback: `createRequest` throws with unique constraint message → cleanup uploaded files → re-fetch by `clientSubmissionId` → if found: log `[route] idempotent race recovered: REQ-XXXX` → return `{ ok: true, referenceCode }`; if not found: return 500
- All three paths return identical `{ ok: true, referenceCode }` response shape — client cannot distinguish them
- Race detection: string-matches `"23505"` (Postgres unique violation code) or `"unique constraint"` in error message; all other DB errors remain 500
- `app/api/request/__tests__/route.test.ts` created: 11 route-level tests covering:
  - normal success flow
  - upload order (uploadRequestFiles called before createRequest)
  - replay returns existing referenceCode
  - replay does not call uploadRequestFiles or createRequest
  - response shape identity between normal and replay
  - race: cleanup + fetch existing → success
  - race: cleanup + fetch returns null → 500
  - non-unique DB error → 500 (no race recovery attempted)
  - payload validation failure
  - file validation failure
- `src/services/__tests__/db.test.ts` updated: 4 new tests for `getRequestByClientSubmissionId` (returns code, returns null, throws on error, includes error message); total 10 tests in file
- Total tests: 104 (was 89) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

Architecture confirmed before implementation:
- Option A (route-level lookup) chosen over Option B (RPC-level upsert) — keeps `create_request` RPC as pure insert; deduplication logic in the orchestration layer where it belongs
- Both replay paths (lookup hit and race recovery) log distinct messages but return identical response
- UNIQUE constraint is the DB safety net; application-level lookup is an optimization to avoid unnecessary uploads on replays

---

### 2026-06-22 — Stage 3C.3.5 — Client Name

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `clientName` field added to `requestFormSchema`: required, `.trim()`, min 2, max 30
- `CLIENT_NAME_REQUIRED`, `CLIENT_NAME_TOO_SHORT`, `CLIENT_NAME_TOO_LONG` added to `VALIDATION_KEYS`
- `MESSAGE_TO_I18N_KEY` in `lib/errors.ts` updated with three new mappings
- `REQUEST_FIELDS.clientName` added to BFF
- `ParsedRequestPayload.clientName: string` added; `parseRequestFormData` reads the field from FormData
- `CreateRequestParams.clientName` updated from `string | undefined` to `string`; `?? null` fallback removed from RPC call
- Route handler wired: `clientName: payload.clientName` replaces the previous `clientName: undefined` placeholder
- `RequestForm.tsx`: `clientName` TextInput added as first form field; `defaultValues` and `FormData.append` updated
- i18n: `clientNameLabel`, `clientNamePlaceholder`, `errors.clientNameRequired`, `errors.clientNameTooShort`, `errors.clientNameTooLong` added to `en.json`
- No DB migration needed — `client_name TEXT` column already exists in `requests` table (added in Stage 3C.3)
- Tests: 8 new + existing fixtures updated — schema (6 new: required, too-short, too-long, trim, boundary 2, boundary 30), BFF parsing (2 new: parses clientName, absent → empty string), FormData assertion added to submission test, db fixture updated (clientName: undefined → "Alex", p_client_name null assertion → string assertion)
- Total tests: 89 (was 81) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-06-22 — Stage 3C.3 — Request Persistence

Status: Completed (migration applied, end-to-end verified)

Completed:

- `supabase/migrations/20260622000000_create_requests.sql` created:
  - `request_seq` sequence (global, no yearly reset)
  - `requests` table: id (UUID PK), reference_code (UNIQUE), client_submission_id (UNIQUE), description, placement, size, color, email, phone, contact_other, consent, status (default 'new'), read_at (nullable), created_at
  - `request_files` table: id (UUID PK), request_id (FK → requests, CASCADE), type, storage_path, original_name, mime_type, size, created_at
  - RLS enabled on both tables; no policies (service_role key bypasses RLS)
  - `create_request(...)` RPC function: atomically inserts request + files, generates `reference_code` (`REQ-YYYY-NNNN`), returns `{ id, referenceCode }`
- `src/services/db.ts` created: `createRequest(params)` calls RPC, maps optional fields to null, returns `CreatedRequest`
- `src/services/index.ts` updated: exports `createRequest` and `CreatedRequest`
- `app/api/request/route.ts` updated:
  - calls `uploadRequestFiles` then `createRequest` in sequence
  - on DB failure: cleanup uploaded storage files, log attempt and result, return 500
  - returns `{ ok: true, referenceCode }` (replaces temporary UUID placeholder)
- `src/features/request/ui/RequestForm.tsx` updated: `requestId` → `referenceCode`; reads `response.referenceCode`; renders via `successReferenceCode` i18n key
- `src/shared/i18n/messages/en.json` updated: `successRequestId` → `successReferenceCode` with `{referenceCode}` interpolation
- `src/services/__tests__/db.test.ts` created: 5 tests — correct RPC call, null optional fields, empty files, RPC error throws, error message propagated
- `src/features/request/__tests__/RequestForm.submission.test.tsx` updated: all `requestId` mock values replaced with `referenceCode`
- Total tests: 81 (was 74) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

Post-implementation fixes during migration runtime debugging:

- `GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE request_seq TO service_role` — sequence not auto-granted to service_role in Supabase SQL migrations
- `GRANT INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE requests TO service_role` — table permissions not auto-granted either
- `GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON TABLE request_files TO service_role` — same root cause
- Root cause documented: Supabase `service_role` has `BYPASSRLS` but does NOT receive table/sequence permissions automatically when schema is created via SQL (unlike dashboard-created tables); all grants must be explicit in migration
- `UPDATE` on `requests` included proactively for admin panel status/read_at updates (Stage 4B)
- `SECURITY DEFINER` evaluated and rejected in favour of explicit grants — maintains least privilege, respects RLS model

End-to-end verification (manual, real Supabase):

- Migration applied successfully in Supabase SQL Editor
- `requests` and `request_files` tables created with RLS enabled
- `create_request` RPC function verified in Database → Functions
- `request_seq` sequence created and accessible to `service_role`
- Real form submission completed end-to-end
- `referenceCode` generated correctly (`REQ-2026-NNNN` format)
- Request record persisted in `requests` table
- File records persisted in `request_files` table
- Files visible in Supabase Storage under `{clientSubmissionId}/reference/` and `.../placement/`
- Success screen displays `referenceCode`
- Cleanup-on-failure path verified during debugging (storage files deleted on DB error)

---

### 2026-06-21 — Documentation sync before Stage 3C.3

Status: Documentation only

Decisions recorded:

- **Reference Code**: human-facing `referenceCode` field (`REQ-YYYY-NNNN`) — server-generated, stored in DB, shown on success screen and in admin panel. DB UUID remains primary key; `clientSubmissionId` remains technical idempotency/storage identifier. See PROJECT_DECISIONS.md — Reference Code Decision.
- **Client Name**: required `clientName` field added to product scope. Dedicated small stage `3C.3.5` added before admin work. See PROJECT_DECISIONS.md — Client Name Decision.
- **AI Tattoo Title**: recorded as a post-MVP backlog idea only — no architecture work, no DB column reserved. See PROJECT_BACKLOG.md.

Plan updates:

- `3C.3` updated: `referenceCode` generation added to scope; `clientName` column noted in schema task
- `3C.3.5` added: dedicated Client Name field stage
- `3D.0` updated: deduplication returns existing `referenceCode` from DB
- `requestId` terminology clarified throughout plan: `requestId` in historical log entries preserved as-is (refers to the temporary placeholder value); `referenceCode` used for the permanent human-facing identifier going forward

No code changes.

### 2026-06-21 — Stage 3C.2.2 — Storage Integration

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `src/services/storage.ts` created: `uploadRequestFiles(files, clientSubmissionId)` — uploads reference and placement images to `request-images/{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/` with deterministic filenames (`reference-01.jpg`, `placement-01.jpg`, ...)
- Per-file retry: up to 3 attempts, exponential backoff (200ms base), transient errors only (`isTransientError()` checks network/timeout/5xx keywords)
- Cleanup on failure: tracks uploaded paths, calls `supabase.storage.remove()` on partial failure — logs attempt and result, does not rethrow cleanup errors
- `UploadedFile` and `FileType` types exported through `src/services/index.ts`
- Route handler (`app/api/request/route.ts`) updated: `uploadRequestFiles` called after `validateFiles`; temporary success response unchanged
- 8 tests in `src/services/__tests__/storage.test.ts`: upload success, empty files, retry success, retry exhaustion, non-transient no-retry, partial cleanup, cleanup failure logging, no cleanup when nothing uploaded
- Total tests: 74 (was 66) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-06-21 — Stage 3C.2.1 — Storage Foundation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `clientSubmissionId` field added to `REQUEST_FIELDS` constant
- `ParsedRequestPayload` interface updated: `clientSubmissionId: string` added
- `UUID_REGEX` and `ClientSubmissionIdError` added to `src/bff/request.ts`; `parseRequestFormData` validates presence and UUID v4 format — throws `ClientSubmissionIdError` on failure
- `ClientSubmissionIdError` exported through `src/bff/index.ts`
- Route handler updated: catches `ClientSubmissionIdError` and returns 400 with structured `VALIDATION_ERROR` (not 500)
- `RequestForm.tsx`: `clientSubmissionId` generated once via `useState(() => crypto.randomUUID())`, appended to FormData on every submit
- Tests updated: `clientSubmissionId` added to all `validPayload` fixtures; 5 new tests added (parses id, missing → throws, invalid → throws, UUID v1 rejected, UUID v4 accepted, FormData includes valid UUID)
- Total tests: 66 (was 61) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-06-21 — Stage 3C.2 — Architecture Review (documentation only)

Status: Documentation sync completed

Decisions recorded:

- Image Proxy rejected; signed URLs chosen for admin image access (technical review completed)
- Single private bucket `request-images` confirmed
- Folder structure: `request-images/{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/`
- Storage filenames: deterministic by type and index; originalName as DB metadata only
- `clientSubmissionId` moved forward from Stage 3D into Stage 3C.2.1 (storage use only)
- Upload reliability: per-file retry, 2–3 attempts, exponential backoff, transient failures only
- Failure handling: all-or-nothing; cleanup + logging on upload failure and DB failure
- Stage 3C.2 split into 3C.2.1 (Storage Foundation) and 3C.2.2 (Storage Integration)
- PROJECT_DECISIONS.md, PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md updated

No code changes.

---

### 2026-06-21 — Stage 3C.1 — Supabase Foundation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `@supabase/supabase-js 2.108.2` added as dependency
- `.env.example` created with `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
- `src/config/index.ts` populated: `requireEnv()` helper, `config.supabase.url` + `config.supabase.secretKey` — throws at module load if env vars missing
- `src/services/supabase.ts` created: server-side Supabase client with `persistSession: false`
- `src/services/index.ts` updated: exports `supabase` through public API
- `docs/project/PROJECT_DECISIONS.md` updated: MVP Quality Standard, Admin Authentication Requirement, Quality Gates Policy
- `docs/files-structure.md` updated
- Connection verification: manual — `pnpm dev` startup throws immediately if env vars are missing; first real DB query in Stage 3C.3 will confirm network connectivity
- lint / typecheck / tests (61/61) / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-06-20 — Stage 3B Pre-3C Fixes

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `ParsedRequestPayload.consent` typed as `true | undefined`; unsafe `(undefined as unknown as true)` cast removed from `parseRequestFormData`
- `RequestForm.tsx`: success branch now gates on `response.ok === true`; `requestId` stored as `response.requestId ?? null` and rendered conditionally — decouples success state from requestId presence
- `en.json`: removed "(optional)" from Email, Phone, Other contact labels — redundant with existing contact section hint
- Contact validation timing: confirmed implementation bug — `z.literal(true)` returns `INVALID` (aborted) when consent is missing, which causes `ZodObject` to abort entirely, skipping `superRefine`. Result: contact group error and any server-side file error never appear on first submit when consent is also missing. Fix: replaced `z.literal(true)` with `z.custom<true>(v => v === true, { message: K.CONSENT_REQUIRED, fatal: false })` — non-fatal custom validation marks dirty instead of aborting, so `superRefine` always runs. All 54 tests pass.

---

### 2026-06-20 — Stage 3B.5 — File Transport Validation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `validateFiles()` added to `src/bff/validateFiles.ts`: checks MIME type and file size per field, returns `FileValidationResult`
- allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/heic`, `image/heif`
- max file size: 10 MB per file; first failing file per field stops further checks on that field
- `ValidationErrorResult` reused — errors surface through existing `fieldErrors` contract
- `src/bff/index.ts` updated: exports `validateFiles` and `FileValidationResult`
- `app/api/request/route.ts` updated: sequential flow — `validateRequestPayload` first, then `validateFiles`
- `file_type_invalid` and `file_too_large` keys added to `MESSAGE_TO_I18N_KEY` and `en.json`
- upload format hint (`uploadFormatsHint`) added to `en.json`; both `FileUploadInput` fields in `RequestForm` show combined hint
- 9 new tests in `src/bff/__tests__/validateFiles.test.ts`; all 54 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-20 — Stage 3B.4 — Server Validation UX

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `setError` extracted from `useForm` in `RequestForm.tsx`
- `onSubmit` updated: when API returns `ok: false` with `code === "VALIDATION_ERROR"`, maps `fieldErrors` entries to `setError(field, { message })` using first error per field
- `status` reset to `"idle"` after field errors are set — form stays interactive for retry
- Empty `fieldErrors` with `VALIDATION_ERROR` falls back to generic `"error"` status
- Non-validation errors keep existing generic error behavior unchanged
- 3 new tests: fieldErrors mapped to field UI, empty fieldErrors → generic error banner, retry after validation error
- all 45 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.3 — Server validation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `validateRequestPayload()` added to `src/bff/request.ts`: reuses `requestFormSchema.safeParse()`, returns typed `ValidationResult`
- `parseRequestFormData()` updated: consent `"true"` string converted to boolean `true`
- `ParsedRequestPayload` updated: `consent: true` (boolean literal)
- `POST /api/request` route handler updated: validates payload, returns 400 + structured error or 500 on exception
- Error contract: `{ ok: false, error: { code: "VALIDATION_ERROR", fieldErrors, formErrors } }` for validation failures
- `src/bff/index.ts` updated: exports `validateRequestPayload` and new types
- `eslint.config.mjs`: added `features/*/validation` to allow-list for BFF import
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: dependency rule updated — `bff → features/*/validation` explicitly allowed
- 10 new tests in `src/bff/__tests__/validateRequestPayload.test.ts`; 2 existing tests updated in `request.test.ts`
- all 42 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-06 — Documentation — Stage 3B.4 Server Validation UX added to plan

Status: Documentation only

Notes:

- Added Stage 3B.4 — Server Validation UX to PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md immediately after Stage 3B.3.
- Scope: consume server `fieldErrors` response, map to RHF `setError()`, display per-field server errors, preserve existing client-side UX.
- Former Stage 3B.4 (File transport) renumbered to Stage 3B.5.
- No code changes.

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.2 — Success / Error UX

Status: Completed

Completed:

- local submit state machine: idle → submitting → success | error
- success: form replaced with inline success block showing requestId from API response
- error (API failure or network error): inline alert banner, form remains visible for retry
- loading: button disabled, text switches to "Sending…" key
- 5 new i18n keys added to `request` namespace: submitButtonLoading, successTitle, successMessage, successRequestId, errorMessage
- 4 new tests added: success state, error (API), error (network), retry flow
- all 30 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-06 — Documentation — Request Identity & Idempotency decision recorded

Status: Documentation only

Notes:

- Production requirement identified during Stage 3 review: without a deduplication mechanism, users can accidentally submit duplicate requests (refresh, network retry, repeated taps).
- Decision recorded in PROJECT_DECISIONS.md: introduce `clientSubmissionId` (UUID), generated on the client before submission, stored in the database with a unique constraint.
- Server behavior defined: idempotent — if `clientSubmissionId` already exists, return existing request info without creating a duplicate.
- UX goal added: user and artist both receive the same request reference ID; Telegram notifications include it.
- Stage 3D added to PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as the dedicated implementation stage for this story.
- Former Stage 3D (Notifications and Stabilization) renamed to Stage 3E; sub-stage labels updated accordingly.
- Not assigned to Stage 3B.2.

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.1 — Payload contract + API route + first end-to-end submit

Status: Completed

Completed:

- FormData contract defined: text fields + repeated file keys (referenceImages, placementImages), optional fields omitted when empty, consent as string "true"
- src/bff/request.ts: ParsedRequestPayload interface + parseRequestFormData()
- src/bff/index.ts: exports parseRequestFormData and ParsedRequestPayload as public API
- app/api/request/route.ts: POST handler, parses FormData via BFF, returns { ok: true, requestId: uuid }
- RequestForm.tsx: onSubmit replaced with real fetch to /api/request, console.log on response

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3 — Planning sync (round 2)

Status: Planning completed

Notes:

- File data model direction confirmed: typed file collection (type, storagePath, originalName, mimeType, size)
- Two upload inputs on current form confirmed: reference images and placement images — map to type values

- Stale backlog item removed: "real upload flow to storage" (now Stage 3C task, not backlog)
