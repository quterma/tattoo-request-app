## Current Stage

Stage: Stage 3 — Request Flow
Status: In Progress

Current focus:

- Stage 3D.5.3 — Supabase CLI Migration Workflow (next)
- then Stage 4A — Admin Authentication

Completed stages:

- Stage 3D — Request Identity & Idempotency ✓
- Stage 3D.5.1 — Architecture & Documentation Audit ✓
- Stage 3D.5.2 — Audit Fix Pass ✓

Architecture decisions confirmed for Stage 3C.2:

- Private Supabase Storage bucket: `request-images`
- Folder structure: `request-images/{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/`
- Storage filenames: deterministic (`reference-01.jpg`, `placement-01.jpg`, ...) — not original filenames
- Image access: signed URLs generated server-side; Image Proxy rejected
- Images: originals stored without compression or resizing
- `clientSubmissionId` introduced in 3C.2.1 for storage use; full idempotency remains Stage 3D
- Upload reliability: per-file retry, 2–3 attempts, backoff, transient failures only
- Failure handling: all-or-nothing; cleanup + logging on upload failure and DB failure

Completed in Stage 3:

- form config (SIZE_OPTIONS, COLOR_OPTIONS, PLACEMENT_OPTIONS, MAX_FILES_PER_FIELD)
- zod validation schema with all fields and cross-field contact rule (migrated to zod/v3 for @hookform/resolvers compat)
- RequestFormData and RequestFormInput types inferred from schema
- i18n namespace `request` added to en.json (labels, placeholders, hints, errors, options)
- request page route wired (`app/[locale]/(public)/request/page.tsx`)
- local form primitives: TextInput, TextareaInput, SelectInput, CheckboxInput, Button, FileUploadInput
- RequestForm fully implemented with RHF + zodResolver, all fields, mock submit
- error handling redesigned: schema uses stable custom message keys; lib/errors.ts has flat MESSAGE_TO_I18N_KEY map + getFieldError/getContactGroupError helpers; RequestForm uses local err() shorthand — no type aliases or nested maps in form file
- final cleanup: lib/ layer added to feature, all component ids explicit, buttonText i18n-controlled, eslint allow-list updated for features/*/lib/**
- select UX fixed: defaultValues for placement/size/color set to "" + z.preprocess in schema so placeholder is shown initially and "" is treated as missing value
- upload trigger text updated to i18n key with maxFiles interpolation ("Choose up to {maxFiles} images.")
- deferred file-upload UX documented in PROJECT_BACKLOG.md
- server validation: validateRequestPayload() in BFF reuses requestFormSchema; POST /api/request returns 400 + structured errors or 500 on exception; consent "true" → boolean true conversion in parseRequestFormData
- server validation UX: VALIDATION_ERROR fieldErrors mapped to RHF setError(); status reset to "idle" after field errors; empty fieldErrors falls back to generic error; 3 new tests added
- file transport validation: validateFiles() in BFF checks MIME type (jpeg/png/webp/heic/heif) and size (≤10 MB per file); integrated into route after validateRequestPayload; errors flow through existing fieldErrors contract; upload format hints added to FileUploadInput fields; 9 new tests
- pre-3C fixes: consent type made honest (true | undefined), success response gated on response.ok === true, contact field labels cleaned up
- Supabase foundation: @supabase/supabase-js installed; config layer (src/config/index.ts) reads SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY with fail-fast validation; server-side Supabase client in src/services/supabase.ts exported through src/services/index.ts; .env.example created
- clientName field: required `clientName` added to form, schema (trim, min 2, max 30), BFF parsing, route handler, db.ts; wired to existing `client_name` DB column via RPC; 8 new tests (schema validation, BFF parsing, form FormData, db persistence mapping)

## Log Entries (reverse chronological)

### 2026-06-23 — Stage 3D.5 — Architecture & Documentation Audit / Fix Pass

Status: Completed

Audit (3D.5.1):

- Full audit of all PROJECT_* docs, code, migrations, and tests after Stage 3D completion
- Findings: 2 Critical (stale stage log, missing 3D.5 in plan), 3 High (client_name nullable, BUCKET duplicate, stale current focus), several Medium/Low doc gaps
- No code correctness issues found; all quality gates passed; idempotency flow confirmed correct

Fix pass (3D.5.2):

- `PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md`: removed stale "Next expected step: Stage 3D" block; updated current focus; added completed stages list
- `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: added Stage 3D.5 sub-stage under Stage 3D; added Stage 3D.5.3 planned sub-stage
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`: added `clientName` to Request Form scope; corrected status values to match DB CHECK constraint (`new / contacted / booked / completed / rejected`)

### 2026-06-22 — Stage 3D.0 — Request Identity & Idempotency

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `supabase/migrations/20260622000001_add_client_submission_id_unique.sql` created:
  - `ALTER TABLE requests ADD CONSTRAINT requests_client_submission_id_key UNIQUE (client_submission_id)`
  - Separate migration from Stage 3C.3 — applies cleanly on top of the already-deployed schema
- `getRequestByClientSubmissionId(clientSubmissionId)` added to `src/services/db.ts`:
  - queries `requests` table by `client_submission_id` using `.maybeSingle()`
  - returns existing `reference_code` as string, or `null` if not found
  - throws on Supabase error
  - exported through `src/services/index.ts`
- Route handler (`app/api/request/route.ts`) updated with three-path idempotency flow:
  1. Pre-upload lookup: if `clientSubmissionId` already exists → log `[route] idempotent replay: REQ-XXXX` → return `{ ok: true, referenceCode }` immediately (no upload, no DB insert)
  2. Normal path: lookup returns null → upload files → create request → return `{ ok: true, referenceCode }`
  3. Race-condition fallback: `createRequest` throws with unique constraint message → cleanup uploaded files → re-fetch by `clientSubmissionId` → if found: log `[route] idempotent race recovered: REQ-XXXX` → return `{ ok: true, referenceCode }`; if not found: return 500
- All three paths return identical `{ ok: true, referenceCode }` response shape — client cannot distinguish them
- Race detection: string-matches `"23505"` (Postgres unique violation code) or `"unique constraint"` in error message; all other DB errors remain 500
- `app/api/request/__tests__/route.test.ts` created: 11 route-level tests covering:
  - normal success flow
  - upload order (uploadRequestFiles called before createRequest)
  - replay returns existing referenceCode
  - replay does not call uploadRequestFiles or createRequest
  - response shape identity between normal and replay
  - race: cleanup + fetch existing → success
  - race: cleanup + fetch returns null → 500
  - non-unique DB error → 500 (no race recovery attempted)
  - payload validation failure
  - file validation failure
- `src/services/__tests__/db.test.ts` updated: 4 new tests for `getRequestByClientSubmissionId` (returns code, returns null, throws on error, includes error message); total 10 tests in file
- Total tests: 104 (was 89) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

Architecture confirmed before implementation:
- Option A (route-level lookup) chosen over Option B (RPC-level upsert) — keeps `create_request` RPC as pure insert; deduplication logic in the orchestration layer where it belongs
- Both replay paths (lookup hit and race recovery) log distinct messages but return identical response
- UNIQUE constraint is the DB safety net; application-level lookup is an optimization to avoid unnecessary uploads on replays

### 2026-06-22 — Stage 3C.3.5 — Client Name

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `clientName` field added to `requestFormSchema`: required, `.trim()`, min 2, max 30
- `CLIENT_NAME_REQUIRED`, `CLIENT_NAME_TOO_SHORT`, `CLIENT_NAME_TOO_LONG` added to `VALIDATION_KEYS`
- `MESSAGE_TO_I18N_KEY` in `lib/errors.ts` updated with three new mappings
- `REQUEST_FIELDS.clientName` added to BFF
- `ParsedRequestPayload.clientName: string` added; `parseRequestFormData` reads the field from FormData
- `CreateRequestParams.clientName` updated from `string | undefined` to `string`; `?? null` fallback removed from RPC call
- Route handler wired: `clientName: payload.clientName` replaces the previous `clientName: undefined` placeholder
- `RequestForm.tsx`: `clientName` TextInput added as first form field; `defaultValues` and `FormData.append` updated
- i18n: `clientNameLabel`, `clientNamePlaceholder`, `errors.clientNameRequired`, `errors.clientNameTooShort`, `errors.clientNameTooLong` added to `en.json`
- No DB migration needed — `client_name TEXT` column already exists in `requests` table (added in Stage 3C.3)
- Tests: 8 new + existing fixtures updated — schema (6 new: required, too-short, too-long, trim, boundary 2, boundary 30), BFF parsing (2 new: parses clientName, absent → empty string), FormData assertion added to submission test, db fixture updated (clientName: undefined → "Alex", p_client_name null assertion → string assertion)
- Total tests: 89 (was 81) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-06-22 — Stage 3C.3 — Request Persistence

Status: Completed (migration applied, end-to-end verified)

Completed:

- `supabase/migrations/20260622000000_create_requests.sql` created:
  - `request_seq` sequence (global, no yearly reset)
  - `requests` table: id (UUID PK), reference_code (UNIQUE), client_submission_id (UNIQUE), description, placement, size, color, email, phone, contact_other, consent, status (default 'new'), read_at (nullable), created_at
  - `request_files` table: id (UUID PK), request_id (FK → requests, CASCADE), type, storage_path, original_name, mime_type, size, created_at
  - RLS enabled on both tables; no policies (service_role key bypasses RLS)
  - `create_request(...)` RPC function: atomically inserts request + files, generates `reference_code` (`REQ-YYYY-NNNN`), returns `{ id, referenceCode }`
- `src/services/db.ts` created: `createRequest(params)` calls RPC, maps optional fields to null, returns `CreatedRequest`
- `src/services/index.ts` updated: exports `createRequest` and `CreatedRequest`
- `app/api/request/route.ts` updated:
  - calls `uploadRequestFiles` then `createRequest` in sequence
  - on DB failure: cleanup uploaded storage files, log attempt and result, return 500
  - returns `{ ok: true, referenceCode }` (replaces temporary UUID placeholder)
- `src/features/request/ui/RequestForm.tsx` updated: `requestId` → `referenceCode`; reads `response.referenceCode`; renders via `successReferenceCode` i18n key
- `src/shared/i18n/messages/en.json` updated: `successRequestId` → `successReferenceCode` with `{referenceCode}` interpolation
- `src/services/__tests__/db.test.ts` created: 5 tests — correct RPC call, null optional fields, empty files, RPC error throws, error message propagated
- `src/features/request/__tests__/RequestForm.submission.test.tsx` updated: all `requestId` mock values replaced with `referenceCode`
- Total tests: 81 (was 74) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

Post-implementation fixes during migration runtime debugging:

- `GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE request_seq TO service_role` — sequence not auto-granted to service_role in Supabase SQL migrations
- `GRANT INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE requests TO service_role` — table permissions not auto-granted either
- `GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON TABLE request_files TO service_role` — same root cause
- Root cause documented: Supabase `service_role` has `BYPASSRLS` but does NOT receive table/sequence permissions automatically when schema is created via SQL (unlike dashboard-created tables); all grants must be explicit in migration
- `UPDATE` on `requests` included proactively for admin panel status/read_at updates (Stage 4B)
- `SECURITY DEFINER` evaluated and rejected in favour of explicit grants — maintains least privilege, respects RLS model

End-to-end verification (manual, real Supabase):

- Migration applied successfully in Supabase SQL Editor
- `requests` and `request_files` tables created with RLS enabled
- `create_request` RPC function verified in Database → Functions
- `request_seq` sequence created and accessible to `service_role`
- Real form submission completed end-to-end
- `referenceCode` generated correctly (`REQ-2026-NNNN` format)
- Request record persisted in `requests` table
- File records persisted in `request_files` table
- Files visible in Supabase Storage under `{clientSubmissionId}/reference/` and `.../placement/`
- Success screen displays `referenceCode`
- Cleanup-on-failure path verified during debugging (storage files deleted on DB error)

### 2026-06-21 — Documentation sync before Stage 3C.3

Status: Documentation only

Decisions recorded:

- **Reference Code**: human-facing `referenceCode` field (`REQ-YYYY-NNNN`) — server-generated, stored in DB, shown on success screen and in admin panel. DB UUID remains primary key; `clientSubmissionId` remains technical idempotency/storage identifier. See PROJECT_DECISIONS.md — Reference Code Decision.
- **Client Name**: required `clientName` field added to product scope. Dedicated small stage `3C.3.5` added before admin work. See PROJECT_DECISIONS.md — Client Name Decision.
- **AI Tattoo Title**: recorded as a post-MVP backlog idea only — no architecture work, no DB column reserved. See PROJECT_BACKLOG.md.

Plan updates:

- `3C.3` updated: `referenceCode` generation added to scope; `clientName` column noted in schema task
- `3C.3.5` added: dedicated Client Name field stage
- `3D.0` updated: deduplication returns existing `referenceCode` from DB
- `requestId` terminology clarified throughout plan: `requestId` in historical log entries preserved as-is (refers to the temporary placeholder value); `referenceCode` used for the permanent human-facing identifier going forward

No code changes.

### 2026-06-21 — Stage 3C.2.2 — Storage Integration

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `src/services/storage.ts` created: `uploadRequestFiles(files, clientSubmissionId)` — uploads reference and placement images to `request-images/{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/` with deterministic filenames (`reference-01.jpg`, `placement-01.jpg`, ...)
- Per-file retry: up to 3 attempts, exponential backoff (200ms base), transient errors only (`isTransientError()` checks network/timeout/5xx keywords)
- Cleanup on failure: tracks uploaded paths, calls `supabase.storage.remove()` on partial failure — logs attempt and result, does not rethrow cleanup errors
- `UploadedFile` and `FileType` types exported through `src/services/index.ts`
- Route handler (`app/api/request/route.ts`) updated: `uploadRequestFiles` called after `validateFiles`; temporary success response unchanged
- 8 tests in `src/services/__tests__/storage.test.ts`: upload success, empty files, retry success, retry exhaustion, non-transient no-retry, partial cleanup, cleanup failure logging, no cleanup when nothing uploaded
- Total tests: 74 (was 66) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

### 2026-06-21 — Stage 3C.2.1 — Storage Foundation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `clientSubmissionId` field added to `REQUEST_FIELDS` constant
- `ParsedRequestPayload` interface updated: `clientSubmissionId: string` added
- `UUID_REGEX` and `ClientSubmissionIdError` added to `src/bff/request.ts`; `parseRequestFormData` validates presence and UUID v4 format — throws `ClientSubmissionIdError` on failure
- `ClientSubmissionIdError` exported through `src/bff/index.ts`
- Route handler updated: catches `ClientSubmissionIdError` and returns 400 with structured `VALIDATION_ERROR` (not 500)
- `RequestForm.tsx`: `clientSubmissionId` generated once via `useState(() => crypto.randomUUID())`, appended to FormData on every submit
- Tests updated: `clientSubmissionId` added to all `validPayload` fixtures; 5 new tests added (parses id, missing → throws, invalid → throws, UUID v1 rejected, UUID v4 accepted, FormData includes valid UUID)
- Total tests: 66 (was 61) — all pass
- lint / typecheck / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-06-21 — Stage 3C.2 — Architecture Review (documentation only)

Status: Documentation sync completed

Decisions recorded:

- Image Proxy rejected; signed URLs chosen for admin image access (technical review completed)
- Single private bucket `request-images` confirmed
- Folder structure: `request-images/{clientSubmissionId}/{type}/`
- Storage filenames: deterministic by type and index; originalName as DB metadata only
- `clientSubmissionId` moved forward from Stage 3D into Stage 3C.2.1 (storage use only)
- Upload reliability: per-file retry, 2–3 attempts, exponential backoff, transient failures only
- Failure handling: all-or-nothing; cleanup + logging on upload failure and DB failure
- Stage 3C.2 split into 3C.2.1 (Storage Foundation) and 3C.2.2 (Storage Integration)
- PROJECT_DECISIONS.md, PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, PROJECT_STAGE_LOG.md updated

No code changes.

---

### 2026-06-21 — Stage 3C.1 — Supabase Foundation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `@supabase/supabase-js 2.108.2` added as dependency
- `.env.example` created with `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`
- `src/config/index.ts` populated: `requireEnv()` helper, `config.supabase.url` + `config.supabase.secretKey` — throws at module load if env vars missing
- `src/services/supabase.ts` created: server-side Supabase client with `persistSession: false`
- `src/services/index.ts` updated: exports `supabase` through public API
- `docs/project/PROJECT_DECISIONS.md` updated: MVP Quality Standard, Admin Authentication Requirement, Quality Gates Policy
- `docs/files-structure.md` updated
- Connection verification: manual — `pnpm dev` startup throws immediately if env vars are missing; first real DB query in Stage 3C.3 will confirm network connectivity
- lint / typecheck / tests (61/61) / build — all PASS

---

### 2026-06-20 — Stage 3B Pre-3C Fixes

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `ParsedRequestPayload.consent` typed as `true | undefined`; unsafe `(undefined as unknown as true)` cast removed from `parseRequestFormData`
- `RequestForm.tsx`: success branch now gates on `response.ok === true`; `requestId` stored as `response.requestId ?? null` and rendered conditionally — decouples success state from requestId presence
- `en.json`: removed "(optional)" from Email, Phone, Other contact labels — redundant with existing contact section hint
- Contact validation timing: confirmed implementation bug — `z.literal(true)` returns `INVALID` (aborted) when consent is missing, which causes `ZodObject` to abort entirely, skipping `superRefine`. Result: contact group error and any server-side file error never appear on first submit when consent is also missing. Fix: replaced `z.literal(true)` with `z.custom<true>(v => v === true, { message: K.CONSENT_REQUIRED, fatal: false })` — non-fatal custom validation marks dirty instead of aborting, so `superRefine` always runs. All 54 tests pass.

---

### 2026-06-20 — Stage 3B.5 — File Transport Validation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `validateFiles()` added to `src/bff/validateFiles.ts`: checks MIME type and file size per field, returns `FileValidationResult`
- allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/heic`, `image/heif`
- max file size: 10 MB per file; first failing file per field stops further checks on that field
- `ValidationErrorResult` reused — errors surface through existing `fieldErrors` contract
- `src/bff/index.ts` updated: exports `validateFiles` and `FileValidationResult`
- `app/api/request/route.ts` updated: sequential flow — `validateRequestPayload` first, then `validateFiles`
- `file_type_invalid` and `file_too_large` keys added to `MESSAGE_TO_I18N_KEY` and `en.json`
- upload format hint (`uploadFormatsHint`) added to `en.json`; both `FileUploadInput` fields in `RequestForm` show combined hint
- 9 new tests in `src/bff/__tests__/validateFiles.test.ts`; all 54 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-20 — Stage 3B.4 — Server Validation UX

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `setError` extracted from `useForm` in `RequestForm.tsx`
- `onSubmit` updated: when API returns `ok: false` with `code === "VALIDATION_ERROR"`, maps `fieldErrors` entries to `setError(field, { message })` using first error per field
- `status` reset to `"idle"` after field errors are set — form stays interactive for retry
- Empty `fieldErrors` with `VALIDATION_ERROR` falls back to generic `"error"` status
- Non-validation errors keep existing generic error behavior unchanged
- 3 new tests: fieldErrors mapped to field UI, empty fieldErrors → generic error banner, retry after validation error
- all 45 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.3 — Server validation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `validateRequestPayload()` added to `src/bff/request.ts`: reuses `requestFormSchema.safeParse()`, returns typed `ValidationResult`
- `parseRequestFormData()` updated: consent `"true"` string converted to boolean `true`
- `ParsedRequestPayload` updated: `consent: true` (boolean literal)
- `POST /api/request` route handler updated: validates payload, returns 400 + structured error or 500 on exception
- Error contract: `{ ok: false, error: { code: "VALIDATION_ERROR", fieldErrors, formErrors } }` for validation failures
- `src/bff/index.ts` updated: exports `validateRequestPayload` and new types
- `eslint.config.mjs`: added `features/*/validation` to allow-list for BFF import
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: dependency rule updated — `bff → features/*/validation` explicitly allowed
- 10 new tests in `src/bff/__tests__/validateRequestPayload.test.ts`; 2 existing tests updated in `request.test.ts`
- all 42 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-06 — Documentation — Stage 3B.4 Server Validation UX added to plan

Status: Documentation only

Notes:

- Added Stage 3B.4 — Server Validation UX to PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md immediately after Stage 3B.3.
- Scope: consume server `fieldErrors` response, map to RHF `setError()`, display per-field server errors, preserve existing client-side UX.
- Former Stage 3B.4 (File transport) renumbered to Stage 3B.5.
- No code changes.

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.2 — Success / Error UX

Status: Completed

Completed:

- local submit state machine: idle → submitting → success | error
- success: form replaced with inline success block showing requestId from API response
- error (API failure or network error): inline alert banner, form remains visible for retry
- loading: button disabled, text switches to "Sending…" key
- 5 new i18n keys added to `request` namespace: submitButtonLoading, successTitle, successMessage, successRequestId, errorMessage
- 4 new tests added: success state, error (API), error (network), retry flow
- all 30 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-06 — Documentation — Request Identity & Idempotency decision recorded

Status: Documentation only

Notes:

- Production requirement identified during Stage 3 review: without a deduplication mechanism, users can accidentally submit duplicate requests (refresh, network retry, repeated taps).
- Decision recorded in PROJECT_DECISIONS.md: introduce `clientSubmissionId` (UUID), generated on the client before submission, stored in the database with a unique constraint.
- Server behavior defined: idempotent — if `clientSubmissionId` already exists, return existing request info without creating a duplicate.
- UX goal added: user and artist both receive the same request reference ID; Telegram notifications include it.
- Stage 3D added to PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as the dedicated implementation stage for this story.
- Former Stage 3D (Notifications and Stabilization) renamed to Stage 3E; sub-stage labels updated accordingly.
- Not assigned to Stage 3B.2.

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.1 — Payload contract + API route + first end-to-end submit

Status: Completed

Completed:

- FormData contract defined: text fields + repeated file keys (referenceImages, placementImages), optional fields omitted when empty, consent as string "true"
- src/bff/request.ts: ParsedRequestPayload interface + parseRequestFormData()
- src/bff/index.ts: exports parseRequestFormData and ParsedRequestPayload as public API
- app/api/request/route.ts: POST handler, parses FormData via BFF, returns { ok: true, requestId: uuid }
- RequestForm.tsx: onSubmit replaced with real fetch to /api/request, console.log on response

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3 — Planning sync (round 2)

Status: Planning completed

Notes:

- File data model direction confirmed: typed file collection (type, storagePath, originalName, mimeType, size)
- Two upload inputs on current form confirmed: reference images and placement images — map to type values
- Mobile upload requirement clarified: native file input for MVP (gallery/camera/files); no advanced upload UI needed now
- Image Proxy technical review scheduled for start of Stage 3C.2
- .env.example / env var documentation scheduled for Stage 3C.1
- Stale backlog item removed: "real upload flow to storage" (now Stage 3C task, not backlog)
- PROJECT_DECISIONS.md, PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md, PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, PROJECT_BACKLOG.md updated

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3 — Planning sync

Status: Planning completed

Notes:

- Stage 3A (form UI) confirmed complete via codebase audit
- Backend slice (API, storage, database) not yet started — confirmed
- Stage 3 execution plan approved: sub-stages 3B → 3C → 3D defined in PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- Storage direction approved: Supabase Storage, private bucket
- Service layer rule documented: no provider abstractions, YAGNI-compliant
- File access decision documented: Image Proxy through BFF (pending short technical review before implementation)
- PROJECT_DECISIONS.md, PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md, PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md updated to reflect all decisions
