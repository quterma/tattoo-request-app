## Current Stage

Stage: Stage 3 — Request Flow
Status: In Progress

Current focus:

- Stage 3C — Data Layer

Completed in Stage 3:

- form config (SIZE_OPTIONS, COLOR_OPTIONS, PLACEMENT_OPTIONS, MAX_FILES_PER_FIELD)
- zod validation schema with all fields and cross-field contact rule (migrated to zod/v3 for @hookform/resolvers compat)
- RequestFormData and RequestFormInput types inferred from schema
- i18n namespace `request` added to en.json (labels, placeholders, hints, errors, options)
- request page route wired (`app/[locale]/(public)/request/page.tsx`)
- local form primitives: TextInput, TextareaInput, SelectInput, CheckboxInput, Button, FileUploadInput
- RequestForm fully implemented with RHF + zodResolver, all fields, mock submit
- error handling redesigned: schema uses stable custom message keys; lib/errors.ts has flat MESSAGE_TO_I18N_KEY map + getFieldError/getContactGroupError helpers; RequestForm uses local err() shorthand — no type aliases or nested maps in form file
- final cleanup: lib/ layer added to feature, all component ids explicit, buttonText i18n-controlled, eslint allow-list updated for features/*/lib/**
- select UX fixed: defaultValues for placement/size/color set to "" + z.preprocess in schema so placeholder is shown initially and "" is treated as missing value
- upload trigger text updated to i18n key with maxFiles interpolation ("Choose up to {maxFiles} images.")
- deferred file-upload UX documented in PROJECT_BACKLOG.md
- server validation: validateRequestPayload() in BFF reuses requestFormSchema; POST /api/request returns 400 + structured errors or 500 on exception; consent "true" → boolean true conversion in parseRequestFormData
- server validation UX: VALIDATION_ERROR fieldErrors mapped to RHF setError(); status reset to "idle" after field errors; empty fieldErrors falls back to generic error; 3 new tests added
- file transport validation: validateFiles() in BFF checks MIME type (jpeg/png/webp/heic/heif) and size (≤10 MB per file); integrated into route after validateRequestPayload; errors flow through existing fieldErrors contract; upload format hints added to FileUploadInput fields; 9 new tests

Next expected step:

- Stage 3C — Data Layer

## Log Entries (reverse chronological)

### 2026-06-20 — Stage 3B.5 — File Transport Validation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `validateFiles()` added to `src/bff/validateFiles.ts`: checks MIME type and file size per field, returns `FileValidationResult`
- allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/heic`, `image/heif`
- max file size: 10 MB per file; first failing file per field stops further checks on that field
- `ValidationErrorResult` reused — errors surface through existing `fieldErrors` contract
- `src/bff/index.ts` updated: exports `validateFiles` and `FileValidationResult`
- `app/api/request/route.ts` updated: sequential flow — `validateRequestPayload` first, then `validateFiles`
- `file_type_invalid` and `file_too_large` keys added to `MESSAGE_TO_I18N_KEY` and `en.json`
- upload format hint (`uploadFormatsHint`) added to `en.json`; both `FileUploadInput` fields in `RequestForm` show combined hint
- 9 new tests in `src/bff/__tests__/validateFiles.test.ts`; all 54 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

### 2026-06-20 — Stage 3B.4 — Server Validation UX

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `setError` extracted from `useForm` in `RequestForm.tsx`
- `onSubmit` updated: when API returns `ok: false` with `code === "VALIDATION_ERROR"`, maps `fieldErrors` entries to `setError(field, { message })` using first error per field
- `status` reset to `"idle"` after field errors are set — form stays interactive for retry
- Empty `fieldErrors` with `VALIDATION_ERROR` falls back to generic `"error"` status
- Non-validation errors keep existing generic error behavior unchanged
- 3 new tests: fieldErrors mapped to field UI, empty fieldErrors → generic error banner, retry after validation error
- all 45 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

---

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.3 — Server validation

Status: Completed

Completed:

- `validateRequestPayload()` added to `src/bff/request.ts`: reuses `requestFormSchema.safeParse()`, returns typed `ValidationResult`
- `parseRequestFormData()` updated: consent `"true"` string converted to boolean `true`
- `ParsedRequestPayload` updated: `consent: true` (boolean literal)
- `POST /api/request` route handler updated: validates payload, returns 400 + structured error or 500 on exception
- Error contract: `{ ok: false, error: { code: "VALIDATION_ERROR", fieldErrors, formErrors } }` for validation failures
- `src/bff/index.ts` updated: exports `validateRequestPayload` and new types
- `eslint.config.mjs`: added `features/*/validation` to allow-list for BFF import
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: dependency rule updated — `bff → features/*/validation` explicitly allowed
- 10 new tests in `src/bff/__tests__/validateRequestPayload.test.ts`; 2 existing tests updated in `request.test.ts`
- all 42 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

### 2026-06-06 — Documentation — Stage 3B.4 Server Validation UX added to plan

Status: Documentation only

Notes:

- Added Stage 3B.4 — Server Validation UX to PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md immediately after Stage 3B.3.
- Scope: consume server `fieldErrors` response, map to RHF `setError()`, display per-field server errors, preserve existing client-side UX.
- Former Stage 3B.4 (File transport) renumbered to Stage 3B.5.
- No code changes.

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.2 — Success / Error UX

Status: Completed

Completed:

- local submit state machine: idle → submitting → success | error
- success: form replaced with inline success block showing requestId from API response
- error (API failure or network error): inline alert banner, form remains visible for retry
- loading: button disabled, text switches to "Sending…" key
- 5 new i18n keys added to `request` namespace: submitButtonLoading, successTitle, successMessage, successRequestId, errorMessage
- 4 new tests added: success state, error (API), error (network), retry flow
- all 30 tests pass; lint, typecheck, build — PASS

### 2026-06-06 — Documentation — Request Identity & Idempotency decision recorded

Status: Documentation only

Notes:

- Production requirement identified during Stage 3 review: without a deduplication mechanism, users can accidentally submit duplicate requests (refresh, network retry, repeated taps).
- Decision recorded in PROJECT_DECISIONS.md: introduce `clientSubmissionId` (UUID), generated on the client before submission, stored in the database with a unique constraint.
- Server behavior defined: idempotent — if `clientSubmissionId` already exists, return existing request info without creating a duplicate.
- UX goal added: user and artist both receive the same request reference ID; Telegram notifications include it.
- Stage 3D added to PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as the dedicated implementation stage for this story.
- Former Stage 3D (Notifications and Stabilization) renamed to Stage 3E; sub-stage labels updated accordingly.
- Not assigned to Stage 3B.2.

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3B.1 — Payload contract + API route + first end-to-end submit

Status: Completed

Completed:

- FormData contract defined: text fields + repeated file keys (referenceImages, placementImages), optional fields omitted when empty, consent as string "true"
- src/bff/request.ts: ParsedRequestPayload interface + parseRequestFormData()
- src/bff/index.ts: exports parseRequestFormData and ParsedRequestPayload as public API
- app/api/request/route.ts: POST handler, parses FormData via BFF, returns { ok: true, requestId: uuid }
- RequestForm.tsx: onSubmit replaced with real fetch to /api/request, console.log on response

### 2026-06-06 — Stage 3 — Planning sync (round 2)

Status: Planning completed

Notes:

- File data model direction confirmed: typed file collection (type, storagePath, originalName, mimeType, size)
- Two upload inputs on current form confirmed: reference images and placement images — map to type values
- Mobile upload requirement clarified: native file input for MVP (gallery/camera/files); no advanced upload UI needed now
- Image Proxy technical review scheduled for start of Stage 3C.2
- .env.example / env var documentation scheduled for Stage 3C.1
- Stale backlog item removed: "real upload flow to storage" (now Stage 3C task, not backlog)
- PROJECT_DECISIONS.md, PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md, PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, PROJECT_BACKLOG.md updated
