Purpose  
Record important product and technical decisions that should not be re-evaluated during normal implementation.

Scope  
Stable decisions affecting product scope, architecture, and implementation boundaries.  
Does not contain temporary tasks or progress logs.

Audience  
AI agents and developers working on the project.

# Product Decisions

- The product is a production MVP for a single real tattoo artist.
- The product is not a SaaS platform.
- The main goal is to replace unstructured chat-based intake with a structured request flow.
- Mobile-first usage is the primary target.
- English is the active MVP language.
- RU and HE are reserved for later validation and expansion.

---

# Scope Decisions

- Booking and calendar integration are out of scope for MVP.
- Payments and deposits are out of scope for MVP.
- Instagram and WhatsApp API integration are out of scope for MVP.
- CMS and advanced content editing are out of scope for MVP.
- Multi-artist support is out of scope for MVP.
- Advanced analytics are out of scope for MVP.

---

# UX Decisions

- The request form is the core feature of the product.
- Static public pages are intentionally simple and support the request flow.
- Image uploads are part of the initial request process.
- Files are immutable after submission.
- Public users are anonymous.
- Admin access is private and limited.

---

# Architecture Decisions

- The system uses a single web application with a managed backend.
- No standalone custom backend service is planned for MVP.
- Backend-for-frontend (BFF) may be used via Next.js Route Handlers where needed.
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) is the chosen database, treated as an external managed system.
- Supabase Storage is the chosen file storage. Storage bucket must be private.
- Telegram is the notification channel for MVP.
- Global state management is not used in MVP.
- Feature-oriented frontend structure is used.

---

# Service Layer Decisions

- External systems (database, storage, Telegram) must be accessed through the service layer only.
- Do not introduce provider abstractions, DI containers, factory patterns, or interface hierarchies unless a second real provider is added.
- Keep service layer simple and YAGNI-compliant.

---

# File Access Decisions

- Preferred file access mechanism for admin: Image Proxy through BFF.
- Before implementation, perform a short technical review of feasibility and limitations with Next.js + Supabase Storage. Scheduled for start of Stage 3C.2.
- If no blocking issues are found, implement Image Proxy for admin image access.
- Architecture must allow this without UI changes on the admin side.

---

# File Data Model Decisions

Request files are modeled as a typed collection. Each file record contains:

- type: "reference" | "placement"
- storagePath
- originalName
- mimeType
- size

The current request form has two upload inputs: reference images and placement images.
These map directly to the two type values above.

This is the data-shape direction for persistence. Implementation is part of Stage 3C.3.

---

# Upload UX Decisions

- File input must support mobile users selecting images from phone gallery, files, or camera where the browser and OS support it.
- Native file input behavior is used for MVP. No drag-and-drop, thumbnails, or advanced upload UI required.

---

# Development Decisions

- The project must remain simple and avoid over-engineering.
- AI agents must follow framework and project documentation.
- Large refactors require approval.
- New dependencies require approval.
- Testing remains minimal and focused on regression-prone logic.
- Manual verification is acceptable for layout and static content.

# Request Identity & Idempotency Decisions

**Production Requirement — not Nice-to-Have.**

## Problem

Without authentication, users may accidentally submit the same request multiple times due to:

- page refresh
- network issues
- repeated submit attempts
- browser or app interruptions

Duplicate requests reaching the artist are unacceptable for production.

## Decision

Introduce a client-generated submission identifier: `clientSubmissionId` (UUID).

- generated on the client before submission
- sent with every request attempt
- stored with the request record in the database

## Server Behavior

When a request arrives:

- if `clientSubmissionId` is new → create the request
- if `clientSubmissionId` already exists → do not create a duplicate; return existing request information

Goal: idempotent request creation.

## User Experience

After successful submission:

- user receives a request reference ID
- artist receives the same ID in the Telegram notification
- future support and communication can reference this ID

## Planning

This is a dedicated implementation story: **Request Identity & Idempotency**.

- Not assigned to Stage 3B.2.
- Must be implemented before public production launch and before broad user testing.
- Recommended placement: late Stage 3C or a dedicated pre-launch stabilization stage.

# Rule for Future Changes

All architectural, product, or behavioral decisions MUST be recorded in this document.

Any decision in this document may be changed only when explicitly updated by the developer.

---

If implementation contradicts this document, implementation must be stopped and clarified.
