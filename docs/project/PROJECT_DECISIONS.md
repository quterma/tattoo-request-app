Purpose  
Record important product and technical decisions that should not be re-evaluated during normal implementation.

Scope  
Stable decisions affecting product scope, architecture, and implementation boundaries.  
Does not contain temporary tasks or progress logs.

Audience  
AI agents and developers working on the project.

# Product Decisions

- The product is a production MVP for a single real tattoo artist.
- The product is not a SaaS platform.
- The main goal is to replace unstructured chat-based intake with a structured request flow.
- Mobile-first usage is the primary target.
- English is the active MVP language.
- RU and HE are reserved for later validation and expansion.

# Scope Decisions

- Booking and calendar integration are out of scope for MVP.
- Payments and deposits are out of scope for MVP.
- Instagram and WhatsApp API integration are out of scope for MVP.
- CMS and advanced content editing are out of scope for MVP.
- Multi-artist support is out of scope for MVP.
- Advanced analytics are out of scope for MVP.

# UX Decisions

- The request form is the core feature of the product.
- Static public pages are intentionally simple and support the request flow.
- Image uploads are part of the initial request process.
- Files are immutable after submission.
- Public users are anonymous.
- Admin access is private and limited.

---

# Architecture Decisions

- The system uses a single web application with a managed backend.
- No standalone custom backend service is planned for MVP.
- Backend-for-frontend (BFF) may be used via Next.js Route Handlers where needed.
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) is the chosen database, treated as an external managed system.
- Telegram is the notification channel for MVP.
- Global state management is not used in MVP.
- Feature-oriented frontend structure is used.

---

# Development Decisions

- The project must remain simple and avoid over-engineering.
- AI agents must follow framework and project documentation.
- Large refactors require approval.
- New dependencies require approval.
- Testing remains minimal and focused on regression-prone logic.
- Manual verification is acceptable for layout and static content.

# Rule for Future Changes

All architectural, product, or behavioral decisions MUST be recorded in this document.

Any decision in this document may be changed only when explicitly updated by the developer.

---

If implementation contradicts this document, implementation must be stopped and clarified.
